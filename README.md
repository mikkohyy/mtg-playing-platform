# A platform for playing mtg

Me and my friend have this way of playing Magic the Gathering by defining the max price for a deck (e.g. 10 euros), deciding the sets that we will use and build decks based on some price listing of those cards which value stays under the max price. However, nowadays it is quite difficult to get together to actually play with those decks. Hence, to continue this fun hobby and also to improve as a developer, I descided to build an app that makes it possible us to build decks easily and play each other. 

## Planned features:

<ol>
<li>A deck builder</li>
<li>An environment to test decks</li>
<li>Possibility to play against each other with the build deck (however, not implementing the rules)</li>
</ol>
